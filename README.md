# CS50 - Resize
My work for HarvardX CS50's Resize assignment.

A program that resizes BMPs to make them bigger.

CS50 provided the following files to use or for reference - I did not write any of the below files:
* bmp.h
* copy.c (file provided for reference and used as a starting point for resize.c)
